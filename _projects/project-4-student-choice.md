## Specification
For this project, you are going to build whatever app you have been dreaming of. It can be native or hybrid, iOS or Android, it can be wht you want! The only requirements are that is is relatively complex and uses the tools you have learned throughout the course. Let your App come to life!

To begin work on Project 4 [Start the Project in Blackboard](https://bb.courses.maine.edu).

## Requirements
Your app must meet the following requirements and specifications. Deviating from these will result in a reduced grade. Remember this project is graded on a two (2) point scale. If you don't meet all the requirements you will only get one (1) point.

## Submission Notes
When we work with GitHub this semester, I will take the state of your repository at the start of class on the due date and use that for grading. There is nothing you need to do specifically in GitHub.

* You **must NOT** include a build for Android (it's doesn't work anyway) in your repository. 
* You must create a `README.md` file that describes your project and:
	* Project/App Title
	* Basic instructions on usage
	* Any special info we need to run the app
	* Lessons learned (at least one paragraph)
	* You *may* write your report in Markdown format, that would be nice.

## Definitions
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Practice Document RFC 2119 Key Words for use in Request For Comments (RFC) to Indicate Requirement Levels defines several keywords that are used in this assignment and throughout the course. Pay special attention to where they appear in the assignment.

Some of the keywords used in this assignment are as follows;

**MUST**: This word, or the terms **REQUIRED** or **SHALL**, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

**SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective **RECOMMENDED**, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be under.

**MAY**: This word, or the adjective **OPTIONAL**, mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.

Much of this project is adapted from a similar course, [CS 4720 Mobile Application Development](https://cs4720.cs.virginia.edu/category/android) at University of Virginia. Thank you to UVA for the heavy lifting. Green is my pepper.
