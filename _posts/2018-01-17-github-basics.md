## Definitions
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Practice Document RFC 2119 Key 
Words for use in Request For Comments (RFC) to Indicate Requirement Levels 
defines several keywords that are used in this assignment and throughout the 
course. Pay special attention to where they appear in the assignment.

Some of the keywords used in this assignment are as follows;

**MUST**: This word, or the terms **REQUIRED** or **SHALL**, mean that the
definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

**SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective **RECOMMENDED**, mean that there may
exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but
the full implications must be under.

**MAY**: This word, or the adjective **OPTIONAL**, mean that an item is truly
optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular
marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product
while another vendor may omit the same item.
